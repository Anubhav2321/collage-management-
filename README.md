**Learning-365** is an advanced Learning Management System (LMS) designed to go beyond standard video courses. It leverages Artificial Intelligence to help students build coding logic through a highly gamified, cyberpunk-themed environment. The platform features an advanced "Syntax Singularity" coding arena, a real-time community hub, and a secure local Docker-based code execution engine.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🧠 1. Syntax Singularity (AI Coding Arena)
- **Dynamic Problem Generation:** Utilizes Groq AI (Llama 3.3) to generate unique coding challenges based on the student's selected topic, language, and difficulty level.
- **AI Logic Check:** Instead of just checking output, the AI evaluates the student's raw logic and syntax, providing human-like feedback and hints.
- **One-Shot Bounty System:** Students are rewarded with "LMS Coins" only if they successfully solve the mission on their **First Attempt**. Subsequent attempts evaluate the code but yield no financial reward, encouraging dry-runs and deep thinking.

### 🏆 2. Gamified Economy & Social Features
- **LMS Coins:** A virtual currency earned by completing video lessons, passing quizzes, and solving AI coding missions.
- **Global Leaderboard (Hall of Fame):** Displays the top 10 hackers on the platform based on their LMS Coin balance, featuring custom gold, silver, and bronze glowing tiers.
- **GitHub-Style Contribution Heatmap:** A visual 365-day activity graph on the student profile that glows neon-cyan to track daily coding streaks.

### 💬 3. Community Commlink (Real-Time Hub)
- **Interactive Multi-Threaded Chat:** A Discord/WhatsApp style secure commlink for course enrolled students. Supports image, document, and audio sharing.
- **Bounty Support:** Students can attach a "Coin Bounty" to their questions. The user who provides the correct solution is awarded the coins via a 1-click "Accept & Award" button.
- **Integrated IDE & Emojis:** Students can open a floating VS Code-style editor directly inside the chat, run code via Docker, and attach the output to their messages.

### 🛡️ 4. Advanced System Architecture
- **Local Docker Engine:** Executes student code securely inside isolated Docker containers with strict CPU and memory limits to prevent infinite loops and malicious commands.
- **Auto-Google Profile Sync:** Automatically fetches and saves high-resolution Google profile pictures and handles missing names during Google OAuth login.
- **Deep Work Focus Mode:** An integrated Pomodoro timer with Lo-Fi study beats to help students maintain focus during intense coding sessions.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup Guide

Follow these steps to deploy the Learning-365 ecosystem on your local machine:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Docker Desktop (Required for the Local Execution Engine)
- Groq Cloud API Key

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Anubhav2321/Learning-365.git](https://github.com/Anubhav2321/Learning-365.git)
cd Learning-365
### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Anubhav2321/Learning-365.git](https://github.com/Anubhav2321/Learning-365.git)
cd Learning-365
```
### 2. Virtual Environment Setup
```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```
### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 4. Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project's main directory and enter the following data:
```bash
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=your_django_secret_key
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```
### 5. Docker Setup (Optional for IDE)
To enable the safe execution of code inside the VS Code chat modal, you must build the local compiler image:
```bash
docker build -t local-compiler .
```
### 6. Database Migrations & Superuser
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
### 7. Initialize the Mainframe
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
