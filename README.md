## ⚙️ Installation & Setup Guide

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

### **Prerequisites**
Make sure you have the following installed:
* [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
Open your terminal/command prompt and run:
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Anubhav2321/collage-management-.git](https://github.com/Anubhav2321/collage-management-.git)

```
### Step 2: Create & Activate Virtual Environment
It is highly recommended to isolate package dependencies.

For Windows:
PowerShell
```
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
(You will see (.venv) at the start of your terminal line once activated.)

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install all required libraries/packages from the requirements file:
Bash
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables
Create a file named .env in the root directory (where manage.py is located) and add the following configuration:

Code snippet
```DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=django-insecure-your-secret-key-here
```

# Add any other API keys here if needed

### Step 5: Database Setup
Apply migrations to create the database schema:

Bash
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```
### Step 6: Create Admin User
Create a superuser to access the Django admin panel:

Bash
```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
(Follow the prompts to set a username, email, and password.)

### Step 7: Run the Server
Start the local development server:

Bash
```
python manage.py runserver
```
